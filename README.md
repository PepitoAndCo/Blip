Project to prevent people from sending the wrong text to the wrong person based on the level of the language that is usually used

It retrieves the text messages on the user's phone, sends them over to our python based server that stores and sets values to each text / contact. Thoses values are then returned and used to value each text locally and tell the user if the actual level of language is appropriate with the ratio that was calculated, will prompt a warning.
This is to basically prevent drunk people from sending the wrong text to their boss for example.

Project unfinished, open to any pull request.
